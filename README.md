# Fortran-Code-Snippits
Fortran code pieces mostly centered on sorting and searching.
Over time it has become harder and haerder for die-hard Fortran programmers like me to easily find algorithms coded in Fortran to use in their work. I have an interest in Sorting and Searching algorithms, so I have collected or written a few Fortran routines related to that field over time. I'm posting them here mainly so others who might Google for something can find them.
Some of the code is written in 'C' with a Fortran wrapper. This occurs in situations where the 'C' code could be optimized by the compiler better than the Fortran code and ran more quickly.
Some of the code has been collected from other sites on the web and where this is the case, I have attempted to give the correct attribution and links to the original. I have released the code under the GPL V3 license which covers my work but where other links and authors have been referenced in the code, users should follow them to ensure that the code is appropriately licensed for their intended use.
I am very keen to accept any additions or suggested changes to the code.
